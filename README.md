<h1>Tourney!</h1>
<p>Tourney was my Front End Capstone after my first 3 months programming at the Nashville Software School.  It is a React.js application using a local JSON Server, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node, NPM and a lot of elbow grease.</p>

<p>After registering and logging in the user will can navigate to the Library page where you can add different games you want to add to Tourney's Database.  The games are grouped by the consoles they are played on.</p>
<img>
<p>The user can then navigate to the Venue page where they can enter an address to a potential venue for the tournament.<p>
 <img>
<p>*In the future the checkboxes for days of the week will be used in a feature where the a tournament will be automatically created based on game, days available, and even the distance they are willing to travel.*</p>

<img>
<p>And finally the user can pool from the data we have gathered so far and pick a game, venue, date, and even name a tournament.</p>
<img>
<p>*In the future users will be able to sign up for a tournament and be automatically sorted into a bracket.*</p>
<br/>
<p>To run Tourney on your own system you will first need to clone down my repo.  From their you will need to navigate to the api folder and run 'json-server -p 6001 -w tourney.json '.</p>
<p>In a seperate terminal run npm start from the main director of Tourney.  From there you should be good to go.</p>
